							<h2 class="display-4">My journey from operations to tech...</h2>
							<p> I've always been fascinated by streamlining any process. Once I was reprimanded and told to write "I will not do this
								again..." about 100 times. I quickly forgot how I messed up and became enthralled with finding the most effective
								way to complete the assignment. My projects soon evolved to
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wbhWLIDTUo" target="blank">building a hot air balloon</a>. After a time of teaching overseas, I came back to Chicago and worked with
								<a href="https://www.everpurse.com/" target="blank">Everpurse</a> and then moved to the supply chain industry. While at
								<a href="http://www.teysaust.com.au/facilities/teys-usa/" target="blank">Teys USA</a> I was managing 2.5 billion of inventory on excel spreadsheets. After one too many times of the spreadsheet
								crashing, I was determind to find a better way to execute my operation.

							<h2 class="display-4">She was warned...</h2>
							<p>
								As in operations, tech is a framework, a beautiful tool that can be used to inspire, challenge and/or solve a problem. A
								new skill cannot be learned in a vacuum and I was excited to use my new acquired tech skills to celebrate strong
								women who were
								<a href=https://lecatalyser.github.io/Strong-Women-lsalcedo target="blank">warned, were given an explanation, and nevertheless persisted</a>. Learning a new skill is humbling and can be frustrating,
								yet I was convinced the willingness to pivot, sheer grit of perservering would contribute to my asset as a professional.
								One of my most satisfying accomplishments as a developer was writing an app that showcased my
								<a href="https://github.com/LeCatalyser/luisa" target="blank">esense</a>, and how I deal with challenges. My favorite part is the app can't quit, because I never quit!

							<h2 class="display-4">My nod to the supply chain industry...</h2>
							<p>
								I'm a strong believer you can't complain if you aren't providing a solution, so I set out to build the kind of
								<a href="https://beef-api.herokuapp.com/#" target="blank">inventory app</a> I could have use at my previous job. When building the framework I took into account the following:
								1)It could evolve as the categories grew 2) It could be used across many business fields, though I had worked in
								the beef industry, the app could still manage inventory and orders for a boutique or restaurant.
								<br>

								<br> My end goal was to understand the process. I understand it isn't realistic for an industry to scrap everything and
								start from zero, the assest is in leveraging tech to meet their current needs hence the power of API's or other automation
								tools. You can watch a demo of this app
								<a href="#" target="blank">here</a>.

							<h2 class="display-4">Why I'm good...</h2>
							<p> Iâ€™m a laser. I can pinpoint strengths/weakness of the operation and implement procedures to reduce costs, prevent
								problems and increase productivity. I'm good because I have a great blend between technical and people skills, ability
								to explain complex topics to non technical team members. I pivot quickly and not afraid to make difficult descisions.
								I am a bridge between the customer and technical team.

							<p>
								I am a great at learning and adapting to changing circumstances. I have worked internationally and in the US. I have experience
								teaching grade school kids, moving millions of items of inventory with 0 room to spare in my budget, and have trained
								up as a software engineer. It is my goal to take these experiences and place them where I work best, in the middle
								of the chaos, crunching numbers, identifying trends, and delivering wins inside a pressure cooker.
