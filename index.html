						<p>Originally from Colombia, I now call Chicago home. I'm a story teller,

						<p> I’m a laser. I can pinpoint strengths/weakness of the operation and implement procedures to reduce costs, prevent problems,
							increase productivity and make life-long evangelist of satisfied customers. I catalyze the improvement of institutional
							operations with my technical understanding of how teams use complex systems. I pivot quickly and not afraid to make
							difficult decisions.

						<h2 class="display-4">My journey from operations to tech...</h2>
						<p> I've always been fascinated by streamlining any process. Once I was reprimanded and told to write "I will not do this
							again..." about 100 times. I quickly forgot how I messed up and became enthralled with finding the most effective
							way to complete the assignment. Sitting at my desk trying to correct my ways, I had no idea my love for planning would
							evolve into more exciting things such as
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wbhWLIDTUo" target="blank">building a hot air balloon</a>.

							My next iteration was teaching English in Colombia. Motivating teens to learn a new language takes vision, planning, and
							spunk. I moved back to Bogotá because I wanted to invest in Colombia, and what better way to do it, than through students,
							the future of any nation! Teaching my students has proven to be my greatest legacy and a very rewarding chapter of
							my life.

							<br>
							<br> After teaching I wanted a new challenge so I came back to Chicago and joined
							<a href="http://www.everpurse.com" target="blank">Everpurse</a> with wearable tech and then moved to the supply chain industry. While at
							<a href="http://www.teysaust.com.au/facilities/teys-usa/" target="blank">Teys USA</a> I was managing 250k of perishable inventory on excel spreadsheets. After one too many times of the spreadsheet
							crashing, I was determined to find a better way to execute my operation.

						<h2 class="display-4">My nod to the supply chain industry...</h2>
						<p>
							As I added tech to my toolkit, I went from the client frustrated with a problem to the developer in a quest to provide a
							solution by creating the
							<a href="https://beef-api.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">Kobe Inventory Managment System</a>. When designing the framework I took into account the following: 1) It could evolve
							as the categories grew, such as fresh or frozen beef, domestic or imported product 2) The inventory system could be
							used across many fields, such as a boutique, electronics or books.
							<br>
							<br> My end goal was to understand and streamline the process. I understand it isn't realistic for an industry to scrap
							everything and start from zero, the asset is in leveraging tech to meet their current needs hence the power of API's
							or other automation tools. You can watch a demo of the KobeIMS
							<a href="https://youtu.be/pHeFKLR6_ec" target="blank">here</a>.

						<h2 class="display-4">Transferable frameworks...</h2>
						<p>
							As in operations, tech is a framework, a beautiful tool that can be used to inspire, challenge and/or solve a problem. A
							new skill cannot be learned in a vacuum and I was excited to use my newly acquired tech skills to create a quiz app
							that celebrated strong women who were
							<a href=https://lecatalyser.github.io/Strong-Women-lsalcedo target="blank">warned, were given an explanation, and nevertheless persisted</a>. Learning a new skill is humbling and can be frustrating,
							yet I was convinced the willingness to pivot and sheer grit of persevering would contribute to my asset as a professional.
							<!-- One of my most satisfying accomplishments as a developer was writing an app that showcased my
														<a href="https://github.com/LeCatalyser/luisa" target="blank">esense</a>, and how I deal with challenges. My favorite part is the app can't quit, because I never quit! -->

						<p>
							I have worked internationally and in the US. I have experience mentoring, moving millions of items of inventory with 0 room
							to spare in my budget, and have trained up as a software engineer. It is my goal to take these experiences and place
							them where I work best, in the middle of the chaos, crunching numbers, identifying trends, and delivering wins inside
							a pressure cooker.
